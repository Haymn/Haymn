### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Haymen and I am a paramedic that is teaching myself to program.

Iâ€™m currently working on learning the fundamentals of computer science. Specifically, at the moment I am learning about different algorithms and data structures. 

I am also learning programming languages: C, Python, SQL and JavaScript as well trying to learn and become proficient with Vim.

I have a growing passion for AI and its application in digitial health as well as developing software that helps optimimse learning.
